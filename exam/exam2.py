# Random Testing
# --------------
# Write a random tester for the Queue class.
# The random tester should repeatedly call 
# the Queue methods on random input in a 
# semi-random fashion. For instance, if 
# you wanted to randomly decide between 
# calling enqueue and dequeue, you would 
# write something like this:
#
# q = Queue(500)
# if (random.random() < 0.5):
#     q.enqueue(some_random_input)
# else:
#     q.dequeue()
#
# You should call both the enqueue
# and dequeue, methods several thousand 
# times each.
#
# This specific Queue class
# has bugs spread throughout the code,
# therefore you should surround calls to
# enqueue() and dequeue() with try/catch
# statements.
#
# For every input that is
# successfuly enqueued, add that input
# to a list of inputs as a tuple: (input, 0)
# where the 0 indicates success. You should
# also catch all assertion errors coming
# from the checkRep() method, and add the input
# on which the error was thrown to the list
# as a tuple (input, 1), where the 1 indicates
# failure.
#
# Similarly, for every successful dequeue and
# checkRep, you should add the tuple ('dq', 0)
# to the list. You should again catch all assertion
# errors coming from the checkRep() method, and add
# the tuple ('dq', 1) to indicate that the dequeue
# failed.
#
# The resulting list should be the return value of
# your random_test function.
